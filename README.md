## About application 
This is my first client-server application written in java. It looks simple enough, but tastefully, tried to adhere to the concept of minimalism. The application consists of two parts: server and client. Each of the programs is launched separately.
## How to use
#### Server
First of all, the server is started so that the client has something to connect to. This can be done from the folder ```Server``` using the command: 
> ```java -jar target/jfx/app/Server-1.0-jfx.jar```
#### Client
The client program runs from the folder ```Client```.
> ```java -jar target/jfx/app/Client-1.0-jfx.jar```

After starting, a window will open in which you will need to specify the IP address in the local network of the device
 on which the server of this application is running. It looks something like this:
